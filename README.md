# hmaze
This is a simple implementation af a random maze generation algorithm.
Not quite sure but I think it would could be called an recursive implementation
of the 'growing' tree algorithm.

The prurpouse for this little program is mainly for my own education and refreshing
some of the haskell that is gathering dust in the back of my head.
